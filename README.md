## 📝 Description

CropVision transforms raw agronomic inputs—like rainfall, temperature, humidity, and macronutrient levels—into **clear, actionable recommendations**. The app blends a clean, modern UI with interactive storytelling to guide users through each input, explain *why* it matters, and surface **confidence-scored predictions** with tips for success. A built-in dashboard visualizes trends, tracks past predictions, and helps compare how conditions have changed over time. Whether you’re a student, a precision-ag professional, or a farmer experimenting with field plots, CropVision makes agronomic decision-making **simple, transparent, and visual**.

### ✨ Key Features


# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to ML service
cd ml-service

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## 🎯 Goals

- **Enhance decision quality**: Provide reliable, interpretable crop suggestions based on seven core parameters.
- **Make agronomy approachable**: Use friendly UI, tooltips, and micro-explanations to cut through jargon.
- **Promote sustainability**: Encourage crop choices that suit local conditions, reducing waste and inputs.
- **Support learning and iteration**: Save, compare, and export predictions to study what works best.
- **Be fast and accessible**: Lightweight frontend with responsive design for mobile and rural connectivity.

## 🎯 How It Works


# Install test dependencies (optional)
pip install -r test-requirements.txt

# Start the API server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Frontend Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage


# Run tests in UI mode
npm run test:ui
```

## 🧪 Example

### Sample Input
```
Field: North Plot A
Rainfall: 210 mm
Temperature: 28 °C
Humidity: 75 %
Nitrogen (N): 90 kg/ha
Phosphorous (P): 50 kg/ha
Potassium (K): 80 kg/ha
pH: 6.3
```

### Sample Output (Illustrative)
- **Top Recommendation:** 🌾 **Rice**
- **Confidence:** 0.86
- **Reasoning (excerpt):** High rainfall and warm temperatures favor paddy cultivation; near‑slightly‑acidic pH is suitable; NPK balance supports vegetative growth.
- **Alternatives:** Maize (0.62), Tomato (0.48)
- **Tips:** Maintain standing water during early growth; monitor N top‑dress at tillering.

> *Note:* Outputs depend on your model/weights and may vary based on region/season.

## 🧭 Usage Instructions

### 1. Start a New Prediction
- Go to **Predict** → Enter your field/site name.
- Provide the seven parameters (rainfall, temperature, humidity, N, P, K, pH).
- Use on‑screen hints to understand recommended ranges and units.
- Click **Predict Crop**.

### 2. Understand the Results
- Review the **Top Recommended Crop** with a **confidence score**.
- Explore **Why this crop?** to see factor‑by‑factor reasoning.
- View **Growing Tips** (e.g., irrigation, nutrient balance, pH adjustments).

### 3. Track & Compare
- Open the **Dashboard** to see:
  - Recent predictions and outcomes
  - Distribution of recommended crops
  - Trend lines for inputs (e.g., rainfall vs. crop choice)
- Use **Filters** (date range, field, season) to compare scenarios.

### 4. Export & Share
- Click **Export** on the dashboard to download CSV/JSON of predictions and analytics.
- Attach exports to reports or share with collaborators.

  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    N: 90,
    P: 42,
    K: 43,
    temperature: 22.4,
    humidity: 82.0,
